Algorithm 
A program is an expression of an idea. A programmer starts with a general idea of a task
for the computer to perform.
The problem is to flesh out that outline into a
complete, unambiguous, step-by-step procedure for carrying out the task. Such a procedure is
called an “algorithm.”

An algorithm is an unambiguous step-by-step procedure that always terminates after a finite number of steps. It is essentially the idea of the steps a program will follow to perform a task.

Suppose you have a task in mind that you want the computer to perform. One way to
proceed is to write a description of the task, and take that description as an outline of the
algorithm you want to develop.
This process is known as stepwise refinement.
Here's an example to "Compute and display the value of an investment for each of the next five years, where the initial investment and interest rate are to be specified by the user."

Get the user’s input
Compute the value of the investment after 1 year
Display the value
Compute the value after 2 years
Display the value
Compute the value after 3 years
Display the value
Compute the value after 4 years
Display the value
Compute the value after 5 years
Display the value


Get the user’s input
while there are more years to process:
Compute the value after the next year
Display the value
